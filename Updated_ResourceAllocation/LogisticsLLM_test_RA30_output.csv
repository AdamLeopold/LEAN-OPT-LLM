"Considering that these games belong to different genres such as racing, sports, etc., digital game shops need to decide which games to list on different platforms. Each platform has a limited memory capacity, details of which can be found in __apacity.csv_. Predefined values and memory requirements for each game can be found in __roducts.csv_. In this case, the sum of the first and second game must be greater than 5. Our goal is to determine which types of games and the number of each game to list on each platform in order to maximise the total value of the game across all platforms, while ensuring that the total memory usage of each platform does not exceed its capacity. The decision variable x_ij denotes the number of games of type j to be listed on platform i. ","RA_example/VideoGameSales/Capacity.csv

"Amazon needs to allocate different types of air conditioners into different warehouse storage areas. Specifically, Amazon has several storage areas, each with a capacity limit provided in __apacity.csv._ The predefined value and size of each air conditioner type can be found in __roducts.csv._ The objective is to determine the optimal number of units of each air conditioner type to place in each storage area to maximize the total value of the air conditioners across all areas, while ensuring that the total size of the units in each area does not exceed its capacity. The decision variables x_i_j represent the number of units of air conditioner type j to be placed in storage area i.","RA_example/AmazonProductsSalesDataset2023/Capacity.csv

"Amazon needs to assign different types of air conditioners to different warehouse storage areas. Specifically, Amazon has multiple storage areas with capacity limits for each area provided in __apacity.csv_. Predefined values and sizes for each air conditioner type can be found in __roducts.csv_. The number of air conditioners of the first type cannot exceed 10.The goal is to determine the optimal number of each type of air conditioner to be placed in each storage area to maximise the total value of air conditioners in all areas while ensuring that the total size of air conditioning units in each area does not exceed its capacity. The decision variable x_i_j represents the number of units of the jth type of air conditioner to be placed in the ith storage area.","RA_example/AmazonProductsSalesDataset2023/Capacity.csv

"In retail, shops need to allocate various types of products to different displays. Specifically, the shop has multiple displays and the capacity limit for each display is provided in __apacity.csv_. The predetermined value and weight of each product can be found in __roducts.csv_. The quantity of the first one cannot be less than 5. Our goal is to determine the optimal number of each product to be placed on each display to maximise the total value of the products on all the displays, while ensuring that the total weight of the products on each display does not exceed its capacity. The decision variable x_{ij} represents the number of products j to be placed on shelf i. The decision variable x_{ij} is the number of products j to be placed on shelf i.","RA_example/RetailSalesAnalysis/Capacity.csv

"In the context of a bookstore, the store needs to allocate various types of books into different bookshelves. Specifically, the store has several bookshelves, each with a capacity limit provided in __apacity.csv._ The predefined value and weight of each book can be found in __roducts.csv._ The objective is to determine the optimal number of units of each book to place on each bookshelf to maximize the total value of the books across all bookshelves while ensuring that the total weight of the books on each bookshelf does not exceed its capacity. The decision variables x_{ij} represent the number of units of book j to be placed on bookshelf i.","RA_example/BooksSalesAndRatings/Capacity.csv

"In a bookstore, the bookstore needs to allocate various types of books to different shelves. Specifically, the bookstore has multiple shelves and the capacity limit for each shelf is provided in __apacity.csv_. The predefined value and weight of each book can be found in __roducts.csv_. The total weight of the first book cannot exceed 50.Our goal is to determine the optimal number of each book to be placed on each shelf to maximise the total value of the books on all shelves, while ensuring that the total weight of the books on each shelf does not exceed its capacity. The decision variable x_{ij} represents the number of j books to be placed on i bookshelves.","RA_example/BooksSalesAndRatings/Capacity.csv

"A boat dealership needs to allocate different types of boats__uch as speedboats, fishing boats, catamarans, etc.__nto different display areas. Specifically, the dealership has several display areas, each with a capacity limit provided in __apacity.csv._ The predefined value and size of each boat type can be found in __roducts.csv._ The objective is to determine the optimal number of units of each boat type to place in each display area to maximize the total value of the boats across all areas, while ensuring that the total size of the boats in each area does not exceed its capacity. The decision variables x_{ij} represent the number of units of boat type j to be placed in display area i.","RA_example/BoatSales/Capacity.csv

"A boat dealership needs to assign different types of boats (e.g. speedboats, fishing boats, catamarans, etc.) to different display areas. Specifically, the boat dealer has several display areas, and the capacity limit for each display area is provided in __apacity.csv_. Predefined values and dimensions for each vessel type can be found in __roducts.csv_. The number of the first type of vessel must exceed 3. Our goal is to determine the optimal number of each vessel type to place in each showcase to maximise the total value of the vessels in all showcases, while ensuring that the total size of the vessels in each showcase does not exceed its capacity. The decision variable x_{ij} denotes the number of vessels of type j to be placed in display area i. The decision variable x_{ij} is the number of vessels of type j to be placed in display area i.","RA_example/BoatSales/Capacity.csv

"A digital game store needs to decide which games to list on different platforms, considering that these games belong to various genres such as racing, sports, and others. Each platform has a limited memory capacity, with specific details provided in ""capacity.csv."" The predefined value and memory requirement of each game are available in ""products.csv."" The objective is to determine which genres and how many units of each game to list on each platform to maximize the total value of the games across all platforms, while ensuring that the total memory usage on each platform does not exceed its capacity. The decision variables  x_ij represent the number of units of games from genres j (e.g.,sports) to be listed on platform i. ","RA_example/VideoGameSalesWithRatings/Capacity.csv

"Considering that these games belong to different genres such as racing, sports, etc., digital game shops need to decide which games to list on different platforms. Each platform has a limited memory capacity, details of which can be found in __apacity.csv_. Predefined values and memory requirements for each game can be found in __roducts.csv_. The number of games of the first type cannot exceed 10.Our goal is to determine which types of games and the number of each game to list on each platform in order to maximise the total value of the game across all platforms, while ensuring that the total memory usage of each platform does not exceed its capacity. The decision variable x_ij represents the number of games of type j (e.g., sports) to be listed on platform i. ","RA_example/VideoGameSalesWithRatings/Capacity.csv
