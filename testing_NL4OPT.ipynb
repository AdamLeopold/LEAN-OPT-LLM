The operating cost per unit of electricity for each power plant is 10, 20, 30, and 40 units, respectively. The company's goal is to minimize the total generation cost. Due to equipment availability and facility constraints, the sum of the power generation from plants x1 and x2 cannot exceed 1000 units. Similarly, due to personnel scheduling and maintenance requirements, the sum of the power generation from plants x3 and x4 cannot exceed 2000 units. In addition, there are constraints related to the power demand from different power plants: the power generation from plant x3 should be at least 500 units more than plant x1, and the power generation from plant x4 should be at least 300 units more than plant x2. Considering that each power plant has a specific upper limit on power generation (700 for x1, 800 for x2, 900 for x3, and 1000 for x4) due to capacity constraints of equipment and facilities, the power generation must be in integer units as the unit of electricity cannot be fractional.

Laboratory L is conducting a series of experiments and needs to send specialized samples to laboratory M for further analysis. Due to the lack of a direct transportation route between L and M, the samples must be routed through intermediate facilities. Specifically, the samples can be transported from laboratory L to laboratory M via either intermediate laboratory P or intermediate laboratory Q. A total of 10 units of samples need to be transported from laboratory L to laboratory M. The transportation routes from laboratory L to laboratories P and Q can each handle a maximum of c_11 and c_12 units of samples, respectively, with associated costs of t_11 and t_12 per unit. Similarly, the routes from laboratories P and Q to laboratory M can each accommodate a maximum of c_21 and c_22 units of samples, respectively, with costs of t_21 and t_22 per unit. The objective is to optimize the distribution of samples across these routes to minimize the total transportation cost. The decision variables x_11 and x_12 represent the amount of samples transported from laboratory L to laboratories P and Q, respectively.

The company has 100 units of raw materials and 90 units of labor available for production each day. Due to market demand, the minimum daily production quantities for product A and product B are 20 units and 15 units, respectively. The profit per unit for product A is 5 units, and the profit per unit for product B is 6 units. The company's goal is to maximize the total profit per day. What should the company's daily production plan be to achieve maximum total profit?

The detailed data is as follows: | Course | User Satisfaction | Operating Cost ($/hour) | Required Number of Coaches | Required Number of Equipment | |---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------| | Yoga | 90 | 500 | 10 | 5 | | Aerobic Exercise | 80 | 400 | 8 | 4 | | Strength Training | 85 | 450 | 9 | 4 | | Dance | 70 | 350 | 7 | 3 | | Meditation | 75 | 400 | 8 | 4 | The company operates for 8 hours per day and has 50 coaches and 20 equipment available for allocation. The schedule for each course needs to be in whole numbers of hours.

Similarly, due to personnel scheduling and maintenance requirements, the sum of the power generation from plants x3 and x4 cannot exceed 2000 units. In addition, there are constraints related to the power demand from different power plants: the power generation from plant x3 should be at least 500 units more than plant x1, and the power generation from plant x4 should be at least 300 units more than plant x2. Considering that each power plant has a specific upper limit on power generation (700 for x1, 800 for x2, 900 for x3, and 1000 for x4) due to capacity constraints of equipment and facilities, the power generation must be in integer units as the unit of electricity cannot be fractional. Given these conditions, the question is: what is the minimum total generation cost (in unit cost) required under the optimal power generation allocation? Please round your answer to the nearest integer. # Response:\\nformulation: min 10x_1 + 20x_2 + 30x_3 + 40x_4\\nx_1 + x_2 ≤ 1000\\nx_3 + x_4 ≤ 2000\\nx_3 - x_1 ≥ 500\\nx_4 - x_2 ≥ 300\\nx_1 ≤ 700\\nx_2 ≤ 800\\nx_3 ≤ 900\\nx_4 ≤ 1000\\nx_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 ∈ Z+\\nproblem type: Others\")]}\u001b[0m\n",

Through the dataset, the revenue of each shoes is listed in the column \"revenue\". The demand for each style is independent. The store’s objective is to maximize the total expected revenue based on the fixed initial inventories, which are detailed in colomn “inventory.” During the sales horizon, no replenishment is allowed, and there are no in-transit inventories. Customer arrivals, corresponding to demand for different styles of Nike shoes, occur in each period according to a Poisson process, with arrival rates specified in column “demand.” The decision variables y_i represent the number of customer requests the store intends to fulfill for Nike shoe style i, with each y_i being a positive integer.\\n\\nThought: I need to figure out the total maximum revenue and constraints of the text.

Customer arrivals, corresponding to demand for different styles of Nike shoes, occur in each period according to a Poisson process, with arrival rates specified in column “demand.” The decision variables y_i represent the number of customer requests the store intends to fulfill for Nike shoe style i, with each y_i being a positive integer.\n",

The city has three districts, District A, District B, and District C, each requiring one unit of electricity. Each power plant incurs a fixed operating cost, denoted by x_1, y_1, and z_1, respectively, when generating electricity. The cost of transmitting one unit of electricity from Plant X, Plant Y, and Plant Z to District A is t_11, t_12, and t_13, respectively. Similarly, the transmission costs for sending electricity from the three plants to District B are t_21, t_22, and t_23, and to District C are t_31, t_32, and t_33. The goal is to decide which power plants should be operational to supply electricity to all three districts while minimizing the total cost. The decision variables y_1, y_2, and y_3 are binary variables indicating whether Plant X, Plant Y, and Plant Z are operational (open).

In city A, there is a factory that produces chocolate, which needs to be transported to a Walmart store located in city B. However, there is no direct road connecting cities A and B, so the delivery vehicles must pass through other intermediary cities. The potential intermediary cities are C, D, and E. The goal is to transport a total of 10 units of chocolate from city A to city B. The roads from city A to cities C, D and E can handle a maximum of c_11, c_12 and c_13 units of chocolate, respectively, and the transportation cost per unit on these routes is t_11, t_12 and t_13 respectively. Similarly, the roads from cities C, D and E to city B can handle a maximum of c_21, c_22, c_23 units of chocolate, respectively, with transportation costs per unit being t_21, t_22 and t_23. The objective is to determine the optimal allocation of chocolate transportation that minimizes the total cost. The decision variables x_11, x_12 and x_13 represent the amount of chocolate transported on the roads from city A to cities C, D and E, respectively. The decision variables x_21, x_22 and x_23 represent the amount of chocolate transported on the roads from cities C and D to city B, respectively.', 'output': 'The problem type in operation is a minimum-cost flow problem.'}\n"

The decision variables y_1, y_2, and y_3 are binary variables indicating whether Center X, Center Y, and Center Z are operational (open).
