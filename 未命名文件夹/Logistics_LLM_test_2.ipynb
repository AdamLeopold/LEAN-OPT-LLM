The costs of infrastructure equipment such as computers and internet access for these schools are 10, 20, 30, and 40 units per student respectively. The goal is to maximize the efficiency of education resource utilization while satisfying certain constraints due to budget limitations and infrastructure capacity. Due to budget limitations, the combined allocation of resources for schools $x_1$ and $x_2$ cannot exceed 1000 units. Similarly, due to equipment limitations, the combined allocation for schools $x_3$ and $x_4$ cannot exceed 2000 units. In addition, there are constraints related to the number of students in different schools: The allocation for school $x_3$ should be at least 500 units more than that for school $x_1$. Similarly, the allocation for school $x_4$ should be at least 300 units more than that for school $x_2$. Given these conditions and the goal of integer resource allocation (as the number of students is an integer), as well as individual upper limits on resource allocation for each school (700 for school $x_1$, 800 for school $x_2$, 900 for school $x_3$, and 1000 for school $x_4$), the question is: Given the optimal resource allocation, what is the maximum education resource utilization efficiency (in units of efficiency)?

The operating cost per unit of electricity for each power plant is 10, 20, 30, and 40 units, respectively. The company's goal is to minimize the total generation cost. Due to equipment availability and facility constraints, the sum of the power generation from plants x1 and x2 cannot exceed 1000 units. Similarly, due to personnel scheduling and maintenance requirements, the sum of the power generation from plants x3 and x4 cannot exceed 2000 units. In addition, there are constraints related to the power demand from different power plants: the power generation from plant x3 should be at least 500 units more than plant x1, and the power generation from plant x4 should be at least 300 units more than plant x2. Considering that each power plant has a specific upper limit on power generation (700 for x1, 800 for x2, 900 for x3, and 1000 for x4) due to capacity constraints of equipment and facilities, the power generation must be in integer units as the unit of electricity cannot be fractional.

Due to equipment availability and facility constraints, the sum of the power generation from plants x1 and x2 cannot exceed 1000 units. Similarly, due to personnel scheduling and maintenance requirements, the sum of the power generation from plants x3 and x4 cannot exceed 2000 units. In addition, there are constraints related to the power demand from different power plants: the power generation from plant x3 should be at least 500 units more than plant x1, and the power generation from plant x4 should be at least 300 units more than plant x2. Considering that each power plant has a specific upper limit on power generation (700 for x1, 800 for x2, 900 for x3, and 1000 for x4) due to capacity constraints of equipment and facilities, the power generation must be in integer units as the unit of electricity cannot be fractional.

The number of students in these four schools are $x_1, x_2, x_3$, and $x_4$ respectively. The costs of infrastructure equipment such as computers and internet access for these schools are 10, 20, 30, and 40 units per student respectively. The goal is to maximize the efficiency of education resource utilization while satisfying certain constraints due to budget limitations and infrastructure capacity. Due to budget limitations, the combined allocation of resources for schools $x_1$ and $x_2$ cannot exceed 1000 units. Similarly, due to equipment limitations, the combined allocation for schools $x_3$ and $x_4$ cannot exceed 2000 units. In addition, there are constraints related to the number of students in different schools: The allocation for school $x_3$ should be at least 500 units more than that for school $x_1$. Similarly, the allocation for school $x_4$ should be at least 300 units more than that for school $x_2$. Given these conditions and the goal of integer resource allocation (as the number of students is an integer), as well as individual upper limits on resource allocation for each school (700 for school $x_1$, 800 for school $x_2$, 900 for school $x_3$, and 1000 for school $x_4$), the question is: Given the optimal resource allocation, what is the maximum education resource utilization efficiency (in units of efficiency)?

Through the dataset, the revenue of each shoes is listed in the column \"revenue\". The demand for each style is independent. The store’s objective is to maximize the total expected revenue based on the fixed initial inventories, which are detailed in colomn “inventory.” During the sales horizon, no replenishment is allowed, and there are no in-transit inventories. Customer arrivals, corresponding to demand for different styles of Nike shoes, occur in each period according to a Poisson process, with arrival rates specified in column “demand.” The decision variables y_i represent the number of customer requests the store intends to fulfill for Nike shoe style i, with each y_i being a positive integer.\\n\\nThought: I need to figure out the total maximum revenue and constraints of the text.

Through the dataset, the revenue of each shoes is listed in the column \"revenue\". The demand for each style is independent. The store’s objective is to maximize the total expected revenue based on the fixed initial inventories, which are detailed in colomn “inventory.” During the sales horizon, no replenishment is allowed, and there are no in-transit inventories. Customer arrivals, corresponding to demand for different styles of Nike shoes, occur in each period according to a Poisson process, with arrival rates specified in column “demand.” The decision variables y_i represent the number of customer requests the store intends to fulfill for Nike shoe style i, with each y_i being a positive integer.\n",

S1 is all set to send out up to p_1 units of fresh goods every day. S2 can push out up to p_2 units daily. G1 is pretty hungry, needing at least d_1 units daily. G2 is a bit more chill, requiring just d_2 units. No worries on how much the hubs can handle; they’ve got unlimited capacity. Now, about those costs: Getting goods from S1 to H1 costs t_11 dollars, and to H2 costs t_12 dollars. From S2 to H1 it’s t_21 dollars, and to H2 it’s t_22 dollars. And from the hubs to the stores: From H1 to G1 it’s gonna cost you t_31 dollars, to G2 it’s t_32 dollars. From H2 to G1 it’s a better deal at t_41 dollars, and to G2 it’s just t_42 dollars. Let x_11 and x_12 represent the units moved from S1 to H1 and H2, respectively. For S2, it’s x_21 and x_22 to H1 and H2.

In city A, there is a factory that produces chocolate, which needs to be transported to a Walmart store located in city B. However, due to the absence of a direct route between A and B, the transportation vehicles must pass through other cities. The available routes involve passing through either city C or city D. The problem is to transport a total of 10 units of chocolate from city A to city B. The roads from city A to cities C and D can handle a maximum of c_11 and c_12 units of chocolate, respectively, and the transportation cost per unit on these routes is t_11 and t_12, respectively. Similarly, the roads from cities C and D to city B can handle a maximum of c_21 and c_22 units of chocolate, respectively, with transportation costs per unit being t_21 and t_22. The objective is to determine the optimal allocation of chocolate transportation that minimizes the total cost. The decision variables x_11 and x_12 represent the amount of chocolate transported on the roads from city A to cities C and D, respectively.

The factories incur a fixed cost, denoted by f_1 and f_2 , respectively, upon operation. Each supermarket needs to import one unit of chocolate. For supermarket S1, the transportation cost per unit of chocolate from factories F1 and F2 is c_11 and c_12, respectively. Similarly, for supermarket S2, the transportation cost per unit from factories F1 and F2 is c_21 and c_22, respectively. The objective is to determine which factories to open so that the demand of all customers is met while minimizing the total cost.

In city A, there is a factory that produces chocolate, which needs to be transported to a Walmart store located in city B. However, there is no direct road connecting cities A and B, so the delivery vehicles must pass through other intermediary cities. The potential intermediary cities are C, D, and E. The goal is to transport a total of 10 units of chocolate from city A to city B. The roads from city A to cities C, D and E can handle a maximum of c_11, c_12 and c_13 units of chocolate, respectively, and the transportation cost per unit on these routes is t_11, t_12 and t_13 respectively. Similarly, the roads from cities C, D and E to city B can handle a maximum of c_21, c_22, c_23 units of chocolate, respectively, with transportation costs per unit being t_21, t_22 and t_23. The objective is to determine the optimal allocation of chocolate transportation that minimizes the total cost.
