A car dealership is tasked with managing the sales of various car models, with comprehensive revenue data available under the 'Revenue' column in the dataset. Each car model, such as Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Ford F-150, experiences an independent demand stream. The dealership's objective is to determine which car models to stock and sell, with the aim of maximizing total expected revenue focusing on the initial inventory of car models classified under 'FDK57'. The inventory levels for each car model are detailed in the 'Initial Inventory' column. 

Throughout the sales horizon, customer inquiries for each 'FDK57' car model arrive sequentially, following a Poisson process, with demand information specified in the 'Demand' column. The positive integer decision variables, represented by x_i, indicate the quantity of each 'FDK57' car model that the dealership plans to fulfill for customer requests. The goal is to optimize inventory management and maximize revenue within the constraints of the available stock. ",NRM_testing_example/BigMartSales.csv,"Maximize
